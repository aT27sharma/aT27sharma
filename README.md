- 👋 Hi, I’m Anup Sharma
- 👀 I’m interested in Manual/Automation testing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning API testing through Postman, Java, and Selenium.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I learn more about testing, which will be going to help me to determine what tools and technologies are used by the professional.
- I have good experience in manual testing and test case writing.
